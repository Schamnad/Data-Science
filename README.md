## Data Science
My foray into the world of Data Science. I am following the curriculum provided in [OSDSM](http://datasciencemasters.org/) and am working through the courses one by one. Presently I am completing the course thought by [Bill Howe](http://homes.cs.washington.edu/~billhowe/) and his Coursera course, [Introduction to Data Science](https://www.coursera.org/course/datasci).

## Project 1

###Tweet Sentiment Analysis

#### Introduction

Scripts for capturing tweets, creating sentiment dictionary, processing & scoring tweet sentiments, written in Python. These scripts were written to facilitate the clustering of tweet length & sentiment scores in [this research paper](http://arxiv.org/pdf/1406.3287v3.pdf).

Twitter app authentication credentials are required for use of twitterstream.py. Acquire these [here](https://dev.twitter.com/).

## Project 2

### Data Manipulation at Scale: Systems and Algorithms
These are my assignments for [Data Manipulation at Scale](https://www.coursera.org/learn/data-manipulation/home/info): Systems and Algorithms - Bill Howe -- Spring 2016 offered on Coursera.

Topics: Python NLP on Twitter API, Distributed Computing Paradigm, MapReduce/Hadoop & Pig Script, SQL/NoSQL, Relational Algebra, Experiment design, Statistics, Graphs, Amazon EC2, Visualization.
